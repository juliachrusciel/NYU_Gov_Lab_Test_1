This is my coding test for the NYU Gov Lab. I used the current Gov Lab style guide and the current Contact Us page on the GovLab website to inform my design.

I did not include the GovLab header and footer which are universally included on all pages, per the instructions of the style guide.

I sought to create a webpage which was informative while not overwhelming the user with information. I decided to replace the rather overwrought directions and two-dimensional map on the original webpage with an interactive embedded map from Google Maps, which I placed in the "Meet Me" section of the webpage. From this page, the user can click on the "directions" button in the upper lefthand corner of the map in order to get customized directions for wherever they are coming from and whatever method of transportation they plan on using (by walking, driving, public transit or biking), which improves upon the prior model which gave limited directions to the building past a couple block radius. I also included Material Icons and FontAwesome! Icons for a phone number, a Twitter handle and a revised set of directions.

As for the more specific directions, I thought they were more overwhelming than helpful so I directed the user to which side of the building the entrance was and told them to go to the 9th floor. Since there is a front desk with a security person, the more specific instructions would be dispensed by this person and are probably better off not being on the website, for reasons of security and brevity.

I also included a form for emailing. The submit button on the form was formatted according to the style guide.
